# Telecom Customer Churn
Overview: Welcome to the Telecom Customer Churn Prediction project! In this repository, you'll find the code and resources to forecast the churn of subscribing clients for a telecom company. The project's goal is to identify customers likely to unsubscribe from telecom services and offer them special plans and promotional codes to encourage them to stay.

Objective:
The main objective of this project is to develop predictive models that accurately forecast customer churn and help the telecom company take proactive steps to retain those customers.

Instructions:

Step 1: Data Review and Exploration

Reviewed the provided Telecom data and look for interesting patterns.
Explored the data to gain insights into customer behavior and churn tendencies.

Step 2: Data Transformation and Processing

Transformed and preprocessed the data for analysis and modeling.

Step 3: Feature Analysis

Analyzed different features to understand their impact on customer churn.

Step 4: Churn Modeling

Created predictive models to forecast customer churn.
Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics.

Step 5: Best Model Identification

Identified the model with the highest ROC-AUC score.
Determined the best model for predicting customer churn.
